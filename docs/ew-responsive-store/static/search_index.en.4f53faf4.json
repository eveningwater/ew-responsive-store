your project requires using session storage (either localStorage or\nsessionStorage) to persist data, and you want the data to be retained after a\npage refresh while also automatically updating the view when the data changes,\new-responsive-store is the perfect solution.\n\nIt's under 1 KB in size and extremely easy to use. With just a single function\ncall, you can make session storage data reactive, which can be applied to any\nframework-based project, even native JavaScript projects. The library also\nincludes comprehensive unit tests and type inference.\n\n\nInstallation#\n\nFirst, you need to install the ew-responsive-store package. You can install it\nusing the following command:\n\n\n\n\nFramework Dependencies#\n\nSince v0.0.3, ew-responsive-store supports multiple frameworks. You only need to\ninstall the framework you're using:\n\n\n\nNote: Framework dependencies are treated as external, so they won't be bundled\nwith your application, keeping the library size minimal.\n\n\nFramework-Specific Imports#\n\nSince v0.0.3, you should import from framework-specific entry points:\n\n\n\n\nBasic Usage#\n\nThe core of the ew-responsive-store package exports two methods: parseStr and\nuseStorage. The useStorage method is used to make session storage data reactive.\n\n\nBasic Values#\n\nYou can use useStorage to create reactive basic values. For example, let's say\nyou have a counter stored in localStorage:\n\n\n\nVue Template Code:\n\n\n\nAt this point, the value of count is stored in the browser's session storage,\nand it is reactive, meaning it will persist even after the page refreshes and\nthe view will update automatically when the value changes.\n\n\nObject Values#\n\nYou can also store reactive objects in a similar way:\n\n\n\nWhen you change the name property of userInfo, the view will automatically\nupdate, and the data will be saved in session storage.\n\n\nArray Values#\n\nYou can also store arrays, and they will be reactive as well:\n\n\n\nFor more advanced usage and configuration options, check out the API Reference\nsection.","routePath":"/ew-responsive-store/en/guide/","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Introduction","id":"introduction","depth":2,"charIndex":3},{"text":"Installation","id":"installation","depth":2,"charIndex":580},{"text":"Framework Dependencies","id":"framework-dependencies","depth":3,"charIndex":707},{"text":"Framework-Specific Imports","id":"framework-specific-imports","depth":2,"charIndex":990},{"text":"Basic Usage","id":"basic-usage","depth":2,"charIndex":1093},{"text":"Basic Values","id":"basic-values","depth":3,"charIndex":1268},{"text":"Object Values","id":"object-values","depth":3,"charIndex":1647},{"text":"Array Values","id":"array-values","depth":3,"charIndex":1852}],"domain":"","frontmatter":{},"version":""}]
